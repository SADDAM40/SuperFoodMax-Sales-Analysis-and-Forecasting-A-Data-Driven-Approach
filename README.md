# SuperFoodMax Sales Analysis and Forecasting: A Data-Driven Approach

This project has been submitted as my final capstone project for the Business Analytics with SQL and Python Course at RMIT University. It provides data-driven insights and forecasts to support a strategy aimed at increasing sales revenue by 5% over the next two years.

## Overview
The SuperFoodMax project analyzes sales data to uncover seasonal trends, customer loyalty patterns, and demographic contributions to revenue. The analysis not only examines historical data but also leverages machine learning algorithms to forecast total revenue for the next two years. This forecasting is critical for decision-makers aiming to fine-tune promotional strategies and boost overall sales.

## Business Questions
Decision-makers at SuperFoodMax need insights on several key questions:
- **Seasonal Trends:** How do seasonal trends affect overall sales and total revenue over time?
- **Loyalty Groups:** Which loyalty group generates the highest revenue and which group is the smallest?
- **Customer Conversion:** How can the company convert non-loyal customers into regular, loyal customers?
- **Revenue by Age:** What is the revenue contribution of the youngest age groups compared to older groups?
- **Living Arrangement Impact:** Which living arrangement group represents the largest segment in terms of size and revenue?
- **Single Female Segment:** How can the company increase revenue from the single female customer segment?
- **Age Group Insights:** Which age group represents the largest segment in terms of size and revenue?
- **Long-Term Loyalty:** How can the company build long-term loyalty among younger consumers?
- **Top Departments and Commodities:** What are the top departments and commodities in terms of sales?
- **Revenue Forecasting:** What is the expected revenue for the next two years?

## Machine Learning Modeling
To forecast future sales and gain deeper insights into sales trends, three machine learning algorithms were employed:
- **Decision Tree Regression (DTR)**
- **Random Forest Regression (RFR)**
- **XGBoost Regression (XGBR)**

Among these, the **Decision Tree Regressor (DTR)** achieved the highest R² score (0.91) and the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values. This indicates that the DTR model provides the most accurate and reliable predictions of future sales revenue compared to the other models.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis and forecasting results, the following recommendations are proposed:
- **Boost Seasonal Campaigns:** Intensify promotions during June and December—months that naturally see higher consumer spending.
- **Enhance Customer Loyalty:** Implement personalized promotions and loyalty rewards to convert non-loyal customers into regular ones.
- **Target Family and Female Segments:** Develop family-focused promotions and expand the range of female-friendly products.
- **Invest in Younger Consumers:** Build long-term loyalty among younger consumers, a demographic that dominates in size and revenue.
- **Expand Product Range:** Broaden the range of popular commodities (e.g., beef, cheese, and frozen meat) to better align with customer preferences.
